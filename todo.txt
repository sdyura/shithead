## TODO

- animations in online play are all over the place

- add cards being burned animation so they dont just vanish

lib updates needed:
- android spinner does not have theme, does not show +/- (fixed in next AndroidME)
- show green felt background for table (needed as theme is VERY broken on android) (BackgroundBorder in next version of SwingME)
- rotate hands for other players (requires next version of iOSME/AndroidME/me4se)



nice to have/maybe:

- rules description on new game screen
- support a few autoplays before a players is resigned from the game

# Shithead Rule Discrepancies (vs. Wikipedia)

## Common Variations to Implement:
- Implement the "reverse play direction" rule for the 8 card. ??
- **Rule for 7s:** When a 7 is played, the next player must play a card with a rank of 7 or lower.
- **Rule for 5s:** When a 5 is played, it acts as a "reverse card," meaning the next player must play a card with a rank that is equal to or *lower* than 5. (cardgames)
- **Rule for 8s:** When an 8 is played, it is "transparent," meaning the next player must play a card based on the rank of the card *underneath* the 8.
- **Other Special Cards:** Consider adding variations for other cards, such as reversing the direction of play or skipping the next player's turn.
